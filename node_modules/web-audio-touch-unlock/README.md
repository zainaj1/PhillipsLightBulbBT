## Web Audio Touch Unlock

### Unlocking Web Audio - the smarter way

On iOS, the Web Audio API requires sounds to be triggered from an explicit user action, such as a tap, before any sound can be played on a webpage.

This method fixes the issue without you even having to think about it, you just pass your `AudioContext` instance to it and you're good to go!

You can read more about the issue and how this method handles it in [this article](https://medium.com/@pgoloskokovic/unlocking-web-audio-the-smarter-way-8858218c0e09).

## Installation

```bash
npm install web-audio-touch-unlock --save

## Usage

### JavaScript

```javascript
var webAudioTouchUnlock = require('web-audio-touch-unlock');

var context = new (window.AudioContext || window.webkitAudioContext)();

webAudioTouchUnlock(context)
    .then(function (unlocked) {
        if(unlocked) {
            // AudioContext was unlocked from an explicit user action, sound should start playing now
        } else {
            // There was no need for unlocking, devices other than iOS
        }
    }, function(reason) {
        console.error(reason);
    });

// Do all your sound related stuff here
// as you normally would like if the sound
// was never locked
// ..
var source = context.createBufferSource();
source.buffer = buffer;
source.connect(context.destination);
source.start();
// ...

```

### TypeScript

```typescript
import webAudioTouchUnlock from 'web-audio-touch-unlock';

let context = new (window.AudioContext || window.webkitAudioContext)();

webAudioTouchUnlock(context)
    .then((unlocked: boolean) => {
        if(unlocked) {
            // AudioContext was unlocked from an explicit user action, sound should start playing now
        } else {
            // There was no need for unlocking, devices other than iOS
        }
    },(reason: any) => {
        console.error(reason);
    });

// Do all your sound related stuff here 
// as you normally would like if the sound 
// was never locked
// ...
let source = context.createBufferSource();
source.buffer = buffer;
source.connect(context.destination);
source.start();
